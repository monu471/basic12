    "\n",
    "1. Paragraph object: A Paragraph object represents a paragraph within a document. It is a container for text and other elements such as inline formatting, runs, and styles. A paragraph can contain multiple runs or segments of text with different formatting. For example, a paragraph may include multiple runs with different font styles, sizes, or formatting options. You can access and modify the text and formatting of a paragraph using the Paragraph object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run object: A Run object represents a contiguous segment of text within a paragraph that shares the same character formatting. It is the smallest unit of text formatting in a paragraph. A paragraph may contain one or more runs, and each run can have its own formatting, such as font style, size, color, bold, italic, etc. By using Run objects, you can apply different formatting options to specific portions of text within a paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, a Paragraph object represents a collection of related text and formatting within a document, while a Run object represents a specific segment of text within a paragraph with its own formatting. By working with both Paragraph and Run objects, you can manipulate the structure and formatting of text in a document more precisely."
